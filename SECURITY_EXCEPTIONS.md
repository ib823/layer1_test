# Security Exceptions and Accepted Risks

This document tracks known security vulnerabilities that have been evaluated and accepted with justification.

## Active Exceptions

### 1. validator.js URL Validation Bypass (CVE-2025-56200)

**Status:** ACCEPTED
**Date Accepted:** 2025-10-21
**Severity:** Moderate (CVSS 6.1)
**Advisory:** GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx

#### Details
- **Package:** validator@13.15.15
- **Dependency Chain:** swagger-jsdoc@6.2.8 → swagger-parser@10.0.3 → @apidevtools/swagger-parser@10.0.3 → z-schema@5.0.5 → validator@13.15.15
- **Vulnerability:** URL validation bypass in isURL() function that could lead to XSS or Open Redirect attacks
- **Patched Versions:** None available (advisory shows "<0.0.0")

#### Risk Assessment
**Exploitation Probability:** 0.031% within 30 days (very low)

**Impact Analysis:**
- validator.js is only used transitively through swagger-jsdoc for API documentation generation
- The isURL() function is used by z-schema for validating OpenAPI/Swagger schema URLs
- Our application does not:
  - Process user-supplied URLs through the Swagger documentation
  - Allow user input into the API documentation system
  - Use validator.js for any business logic or user-facing validation

**Blast Radius:** Minimal
- Only affects API documentation tooling (`/api-docs` endpoint)
- Does not impact core business functionality
- Does not process untrusted user input in the vulnerable code path

#### Justification for Acceptance
1. **No Patch Available:** Upstream maintainers have not released a fix (latest version 13.15.15 is vulnerable)
2. **Limited Exposure:** Only used in API documentation generation, not in request handling or user input processing
3. **Low Probability:** 0.031% exploitation probability
4. **Transitive Dependency:** Not directly used by our code, making it difficult to replace without removing swagger-jsdoc entirely
5. **Business Value:** API documentation provides significant value for developers and integration partners

#### Mitigation Measures
- ✅ Swagger documentation is available only in development/staging environments (not production)
- ✅ API documentation endpoint is rate-limited
- ✅ No user-supplied URLs are processed through Swagger/validator.js
- ✅ Regular monitoring for package updates

#### Monitoring and Review
- **Review Frequency:** Monthly
- **Next Review Date:** 2025-11-21
- **Automated Monitoring:** pnpm audit in CI/CD pipeline
- **Trigger for Re-evaluation:**
  - Patch becomes available
  - Severity increases to HIGH or CRITICAL
  - Exploitation is observed in the wild
  - Security researcher demonstrates practical exploit against our setup

#### Remediation Plan (Future)
When a patch becomes available OR if risk profile changes:

**Option 1:** Update validator.js
```bash
pnpm update validator@latest
```

**Option 2:** Replace swagger-jsdoc
- Evaluate alternatives:
  - tsoa (TypeScript OpenAPI generator)
  - nestjs/swagger (if migrating to NestJS)
  - Manual OpenAPI spec maintenance

**Option 3:** Generate static documentation
- Generate swagger.json at build time
- Serve pre-generated spec (no runtime swagger-jsdoc)
- Remove swagger-jsdoc from production dependencies
