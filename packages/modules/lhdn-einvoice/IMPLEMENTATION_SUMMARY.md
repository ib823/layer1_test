## Architecture Highlights

### Resilience & Idempotency

1. **Idempotent Submissions**
   - SHA-256 canonical payload hashing
   - 7-day TTL for idempotency keys
   - Prevents duplicate invoices on network retry

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Prevents cascading failures
   - Service health tracking per endpoint
   - Automatic recovery testing (HALF_OPEN state)

3. **Event Sourcing**
   - Immutable audit trail (7-year retention)
   - State reconstruction from events
   - Compliance-ready (LHDN, SOX, PDPA)

4. **Queue with Retry**
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Dead-letter queue for failed jobs
   - Max 5 retry attempts (configurable)

### Database Schema

**Tables Created** (Migration 006):
- `lhdn_idempotency_keys` - Deduplication
- `lhdn_submission_queue` - Async job processing
- `lhdn_dead_letter_queue` - Failed jobs
- `lhdn_doc_events` - Event sourcing log
- `lhdn_circuit_breaker_state` - Service health

**Key Constraints**:
- UNIQUE (tenant_id, idempotency_key)
- Immutability triggers on events (prevent UPDATE/DELETE)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenancy
