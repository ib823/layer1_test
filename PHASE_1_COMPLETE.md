## 🔌 Integration Points

### For Controllers

```typescript
// Send violation alert
import { getQueueManager, EmailJobType } from '@sap-framework/core';

await queueManager.addJob('email', EmailJobType.SEND_ALERT, {
  email: {
    to: user.email,
    subject: 'Critical SoD Violation',
    template: 'violation-alert',
    data: { /* ... */ },
  },
});
```

### For Analysis Modules

```typescript
// Queue background analysis
import { getQueueManager, AnalysisJobType } from '@sap-framework/core';

await queueManager.addJob('analysis', AnalysisJobType.GL_ANOMALY_DETECTION, {
  tenantId,
  fiscalPeriod,
  analysisType: 'full',
});
```

### For API Server

```typescript
// Initialize on startup
import { initializeInfrastructure } from '@sap-framework/core';

await initializeInfrastructure({
  redis: { host: 'localhost', port: 6379 },
  email: { provider: 'resend', resend: { apiKey: '...' } },
  scheduler: { enabled: true },
  workers: { email: { concurrency: 10 } },
});
```
