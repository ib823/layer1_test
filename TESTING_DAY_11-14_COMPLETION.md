## Test Inventory

### Module-Level Test Coverage

#### 1. **LHDN e-Invoice Module**
**Location**: `packages/modules/lhdn-einvoice/tests/`

**Unit Tests** (5 files, 57 passing):
- ✅ `ValidationService.test.ts` - 19 tests (comprehensive validation rules)
- ✅ `MappingService.test.ts` - SAP to LHDN mapping
- ✅ `QRCodeService.test.ts` - QR code generation
- ✅ `LHDNInvoiceEngine.test.ts` - Core engine logic
- ✅ `LHDNInvoiceRepository.test.ts` - Database operations

**Integration Tests** (9 files, 39 failing):
- ⚠️ `FullSubmissionWorkflow.integration.test.ts` - TypeScript errors
- ⚠️ `CancellationWorkflow.integration.test.ts` - Methods not implemented
- ⚠️ `CreditNoteWorkflow.integration.test.ts` - PostgreSQL container issues
- ⚠️ `DebitNoteWorkflow.integration.test.ts` - Workflow incomplete
- ⚠️ `CircuitBreakerService.integration.test.ts` - Service integration
- ⚠️ `EventService.integration.test.ts` - Event system
- ⚠️ `QueueService.integration.test.ts` - Queue system
- ⚠️ `IdempotencyService.integration.test.ts` - Idempotency
- ⚠️ `LHDNInvoiceRepository.integration.test.ts` - DB integration

**Coverage**:
```
Statements: 38.67% (need 75%)
Branches:   37.13% (need 75%)
Functions:  46.91% (need 75%)
Lines:      38.86% (need 75%)
```

**Analysis**: Unit tests are solid (57/57 passing). Integration test failures are due to:
1. Workflow classes missing methods (`withdrawCancellation`, `createCancellationRequest`, etc.)
2. PostgreSQL testcontainer setup issues
3. Incomplete service implementations (CircuitBreaker, Event, Queue, Idempotency)

**Recommendation**: Integration tests were written ahead of implementation. Complete workflow implementations or mark as pending.

---

#### 2. **SoD Control Module**
**Location**: `packages/modules/sod-control/tests/`

**Unit Tests** (2 files, 19/26 passing):
- ✅ `RuleEngine.test.ts` - 14/14 tests passing (100%)
- ⚠️ `AccessGraphService.test.ts` - 5/12 tests passing (42%)

**Coverage**:
```
Statements: 47.72% (need 75%)
Branches:   21.23% (need 75%)
Functions:  51.56% (need 75%)
Lines:      50.42% (need 75%)
```

**Failing Tests** (7 failures in AccessGraphService):
1. `persistAssignments` - Should insert user-role assignments
2. `persistAssignments` - Should handle temporary assignments
3. `createSnapshot` - Should create point-in-time snapshot
4. `createSnapshot` - Should handle scheduled snapshot
5. `detectDeltas` - Should detect user additions
6. `detectDeltas` - Should detect role removals
7. `detectDeltas` - Should detect assignment changes

**Root Cause**: Database mocking issues - mock methods not properly returning chained objects.

**Recommendation**: Fix mock setup or use actual database for integration tests.

---

## E2E Testing Strategy

### Current State
No Playwright/Cypress E2E tests exist for web UI.

### Recommended E2E Test Scenarios

#### LHDN e-Invoice Critical Flows

1. **Invoice Submission Flow**
   ```
   - User logs in
   - Navigates to LHDN monitor page
   - Submits new invoice via API call
   - Verifies invoice appears in submission queue
   - Checks status updates
   ```

2. **Invoice Monitoring Flow**
   ```
   - User opens monitor page
   - Filters by status (PENDING, PROCESSING, etc.)
   - Verifies auto-refresh functionality
   - Checks stats cards update
   ```

3. **Configuration Management**
   ```
   - User navigates to config page
   - Updates LHDN API credentials
   - Saves configuration
   - Verifies changes persist
   ```

#### SoD Control Critical Flows

1. **Run SoD Analysis**
   ```
   - User opens SoD dashboard
   - Triggers new analysis via API
   - Waits for analysis completion
   - Reviews violation results
   ```

2. **Violation Review Flow**
   ```
   - User opens violations inbox
   - Filters by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH)
   - Opens violation detail
   - Approves/rejects exception
   ```

3. **Compliance Reporting**
   ```
   - User navigates to reports page
   - Selects date range
   - Generates compliance report
   - Exports to PDF/CSV
   ```

### E2E Test Infrastructure Needed

**Playwright Configuration**:
```typescript
// packages/web/playwright.config.ts exists
// Need to create actual test files
```

**Test Files to Create**:
- `packages/web/e2e/lhdn-submission.spec.ts`
- `packages/web/e2e/lhdn-monitoring.spec.ts`
- `packages/web/e2e/sod-analysis.spec.ts`
- `packages/web/e2e/sod-violations.spec.ts`

**Total Recommended**: 10-15 E2E scenarios

---

## Test Infrastructure

### Testing Frameworks

**Backend**:
- Jest (LHDN, SoD, Core modules)
- Vitest (Apps/API)
- Test containers (PostgreSQL)

**Frontend**:
- Playwright (configured but not used)
- React Testing Library (available)

### CI/CD Integration

**Test Scripts** (in package.json):
```bash
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:coverage     # Generate coverage reports
pnpm test:watch        # Watch mode
pnpm test:e2e          # E2E tests (web only)
```

**Coverage Thresholds** (jest.config.js):
```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    statements: 60,  // Currently set to 60%
    branches: 60,
    functions: 60,
    lines: 60,
  },
}
```

## Gaps and Recommendations

### Critical Gaps

1. **LHDN Workflow Implementations** (High Priority)
   - CancellationWorkflow missing 20+ methods
   - CreditNoteWorkflow missing methods
   - DebitNoteWorkflow incomplete
   - **Impact**: 39 integration tests failing
   - **Effort**: 3-5 days to implement workflows

2. **LHDN Service Layer** (Medium Priority)
   - CircuitBreakerService (95% uncovered)
   - EventService (95% uncovered)
   - SubmissionService (96% uncovered)
   - NotificationService (94% uncovered)
   - **Impact**: Low coverage metrics
   - **Effort**: 2-3 days for unit tests

3. **SoD AccessGraphService Mocks** (Low Priority)
   - 7 failing tests due to mock setup
   - **Impact**: Minor coverage gaps
   - **Effort**: 2-4 hours to fix mocks

4. **E2E Test Implementation** (Medium Priority)
   - Zero E2E tests exist
   - **Impact**: No end-to-end validation
   - **Effort**: 2-3 days for 10-15 scenarios

### Quick Wins

1. ✅ **API Integration Tests** - Created 21 tests (Day 11-14)
2. ⏳ **Fix SoD Mocks** - 2-4 hours for 7 tests
3. ⏳ **Raise Coverage Threshold** - Update from 60% to 75% once gaps filled
