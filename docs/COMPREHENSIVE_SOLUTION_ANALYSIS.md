## Solution Overview

### What Problem Does It Solve?

**Primary Problem:** SAP customers need robust GRC controls but face:
- High cost of SAP GRC Access Control (~$500K+ implementation)
- Complex licensing and maintenance
- Inflexible workflows
- Poor integration with non-SAP systems
- Lack of localization (e.g., Malaysia LHDN e-invoicing)

**Our Solution:** A flexible, multi-tenant GRC platform that:
1. **Automatically discovers** what SAP services each tenant has access to
2. **Activates modules** based on available SAP APIs (graceful degradation)
3. **Provides GRC capabilities** at a fraction of SAP GRC cost
4. **Extends beyond SAP** to support Ariba, SuccessFactors, BTP, and generic SCIM/OIDC systems
5. **Includes localized modules** like Malaysia LHDN e-invoicing

### Target Market

**Primary:**
- Mid-market SAP S/4HANA customers (500-5000 employees)
- Organizations with compliance requirements (SOX, ISO 27001, PDPA)
- Companies in regulated industries (Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing)

**Secondary:**
- SAP consulting firms (ABeam, Deloitte, PwC, Accenture) as white-label platform
- Multi-subsidiary conglomerates needing centralized GRC
- Organizations migrating from SAP ECC to S/4HANA

**Geographic Focus:**
- Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand) - LHDN e-invoice is unique differentiator
- Asia Pacific (Japan, Australia, India)
- North America & Europe (via partner channels)
